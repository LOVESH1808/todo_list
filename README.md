Due to some errors pushing the code from my editor to github it seems I cant deploy this as a static website in GitHub .

I request that you copy this code in your editor and try the following steps

Step 1: after fetching the project to your local editor , run npm start after installing npm modules
Step 2: all the login and logout functionalties are added , so you have to signup for that
